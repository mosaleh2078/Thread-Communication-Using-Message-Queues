# Thread-Communication-Using-Message-Queues

As the next step in exploring concurrency, I practiced interprocess communication (IPC) using message queues. In this example, I created a priority queue with a capacity of 100 items and distributed it among 10 threads for processing. It's good to know that priority queue module utilizes a heap to manage and retrieve elements based on priority.
